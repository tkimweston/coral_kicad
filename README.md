# coral_kicad
This repository contains the kicad footprint and symbol for the Google Coral Accelerator Module.  
<br>It is a small 10x15mm LGA-120 package.
<br>It is my first attempt commiting kicad library and footprint files to github.  Contact me if you find any issues downloading and using the files.
